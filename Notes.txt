########################React - The Complete Guide######################################
####Introduction
-A Javascript Library for building User Interfaces.
-JS Library - JS driven app.
-React use components to building User Interfaces.
-Component helps us to make code manageable.
-React component can be thought of as custom HTML element.
-React DOM is to rendaring a component.
-JSX has the requirement of only having one root element.
-Use single render call is far most popular way of creating app.

####Understand the folder structure
-Dependencies : library/script  used in application.
-scripts : trigger when we run npm start, npm build. IT optimized code and perform other operation like convert next gen JS features to vanila JS.
-react-scripts : Package offering all the build workflow, development server, next gen. JS features.This has lots of other dependency 
-react-script build : trigger when we execute npm build(when project are ready for production)
-Manifest.json : Used for metadate for our app.
-registerServiceWorker.js  : pre-cache our script and used for PWA(Progressive Web APP)
-App.test.js : Used for unit testing of our app.
-start : compile and optimiz our code
-Public folder : A root folder which get server by the web server in the end.Should contain single index.html page for PWA.
-For multipage application you need to use create-react-app multiple time.
-scr : All the script files is placed here
-div id='root' : Place where we mount out react application.

####Understanding Component Basic
-React is all about components(Custom HTML elements)
-Typically, the react app have only one root component.
-The render method is defined in Component.
-The .JS extension is removed by build workflow.
-The HTML type syntex you written is actually JSX and compiled it to valid JS in the end.


####Understanding JSX
-The JSX is converted into JSX by React we import on the top
-createElement() takes at least 3 arguments:
    1st: Element we want to render(Html or other react component).
    2nd: Configuration(cssClass, style or other Configuration) which is a JS object or null
    3rd: Children (what nested in this div)
    and the infinite comma seprated elements. 

####JSX Restriction
-You can not use words which is JS literals.(like class)
-JSX expression must have root element.

####Creating a functional component
-Best practices is componet Name(Or folder name where you capt component) should start with Capital letter.
-Function name is lower case.
-import your component with Upper case letter because react use lower case started word for default element
    like div,h1 etc..

###Working with component
-Componente make code managable,configurable.
-Use anytime,anywhere as much as you can.

####Outputting dynamic content
-use {single line statement, calling fxn, single line expression}

####Working with props
-One arguments by default passed by react (generally called props) which is an object with all the properties of the component.
-Property is basiclly attribute you passed to component.
-props.children gives the access of <Person>Child Content(Could be a normal content or other JSX or react component)</Person>
-Change in prop trigger an UI update.

####Understanding and using states
-State is used when you don't want to get some information from outside but you want to have it inside a component.
-Like change value on button click.
-A special property you can define in any component which extends component named state.
-State is managed from inside a component (use to manage component internal data).
-If state property is changes it lead react to re-render our DOM or to update the DOM.
-state is state you can't change the name l ike we  can do with props.
-state is only available in class which extend component and access via this.state.

#######Difference between props and state

####Handling events with method
-Don't use () when Handling event like onClick.If you do React execute the function when it render element on DOM.
-You only want to pass a refrence.


####Manipulating the State
-If you want to access this.state always use ES6 Arrow syntex otherwise you may not able to access state property.
-DO NOT directly change the state property.
-Use special method setState() otherwise you may get warning message.
-This method help to get React know about this update and update the DOM.
-Also, setState does not change complete array, it will only update the part that you mention in state.
 
 ####Using the useState() hook for state Manipulation
 -hook generaly starts with use****
 -useState return an array with exactly two element and always two elements.
 -The first element we get back will always be our current state.
 -The second element in state array will always be a function that allows us to update this state,
 such that React is aware of it and will re-render the required component.
 -Remember that you useState 2nd returend value that is function, not merge the data with previous object.
 -Again, insted of manually merg, use setState multiple time.
 -You can have as many useState in functional component.

 ####Stateless vs Stateful Component
 -StateFull component is a component that manages state,no matter it's using the useState hook or class-based approach with the state property.
 -Stateless are also called dumb Component or presentational component.
 -Statefull component are also called smart or container component.
 -Always use less number of statefull component. otherwise it will make your code spaghetti.

 ####Passing Method refrence between Componentes
 -You can pass method also as a props.
 -This help us to call a method which might changes the state in another component which dont have the direct access of the state.
 -There is a two way to pass the data to the handler
 -1st way is to use .bind() and passing this which control 'this' in handler function -> bind(this).
 -bind(this,'Max','Pranay') other then 'this' all are argument list that passed to handler function
 -2nd way is to use ES6 arrow function syntex, and pssed the parameter in that.
 -The recommended way is to use .bind();

 ####Adding two way binding
-
 

 ####Adding styling with stylesheet
 -The webpack enable us to import .css file in .JS file.
 -2 Ways of styling
    -Create css files
    -Inline style sheet(Use power of JSX,create style object and paased it to style attribute in JSX)
    -The inline way have some limitation but can overcome some of them.

 ####Rendering contain conditionaly
 -Yoy can only use simple statement and not the block statement like if(){}, insted use ternary operator as part of dynamic syntex.
 
 ####Handling dynamic content "The Javascript way"
 -Use variable and then assign JSX in that variable based on condition.

 ####Update state immutably
 -Use slice insted of splice.(Or spread operator)

 ####Lists & Keys
 -The 'Key' prop is important property we should add whrn rendering the data.
 -Its actually a default property react expects to find on an element no matter if it's a custom component or default
 html element which you render through a list.
 -This key property helps react update the list efficiently.
 -When we delete the list, behind the seen react needs to find out what it actually needs to adjust in the overall DOM.
 -Key property allows react to keep track of individual element so that it has clear property it can compare between the different element 
 to find out which element change and which didn't.

 ####Flixible List
 -Always use id for list.
 -Always use immutable way to change object.

 ####Adding and using radium
 -Radium is popular package for react which allows us to use inline style with pseudo selector and media queries.
 -npm install --save radium
 -Radium(App) is higher order component
 -Radium works with both functional and class based component.

 ####Using Radium with media-queries
 -Transforming selectors like media queries or other animations with keyframes,we need to wrap the entire application in a
 special component provided by Radium called StyleRoot.
 -Wrap your whole application in <StyleRoot></StyleRoot>.

 ####Introduction Styled Component
 -Another popular library for styling react component is styled-components.
 -styles-component.com
 -This use the concept of tagged templet literal for vanilla JS.
 -You need to pass some text between back ticks and then it will passed to that element.Ex- styled.button``
 -import styled from 'styled-components'
 -const StyledDiv = styled.div`
    width: 60%;
    margin: 16px auto;
    border: 1px solid #eee;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 3px #ccc;
    padding: 16px;
    text-align: center;

    @media(min-width: 500px) {
        width: 450px;
    }`
-Behind the seen styled.xyz always return a react component.

####More on styled component
-Under the hood the style apply as classes and not the inline way.styled-component provides the class name to styles and then apply that class name the HTML elements.
-Remember you write actual regular CSS syntex under back ticks.(No camel style, no quotation marks)
-Add &hover wen use hover.

####Styled componenet and Dynamic Styled
-You can add any property to styled component and then use that using props.
-You can embeded the JS in templet literal using ${props.alt ? 'red' : 'green'}

####Working with CSS modules
-Sometime its good to write styles which only apply to specific component and not the complete part.
-Having CSS scope to certain file or scope to certain componenet and still lives inside of CSS as file.
-This also have good IDE support.
-To achieve this we have a concept of CSS Modules.
-Run npm run eject and it will eject from the under the hood configuration and give access to underlying webpack config files.
